Hello! Thanks for visiting my Portfolio repo.

Developed with React, styled with css and with some JavaScript this is an app that shows a bit of me, my projects and my experience.
It has a responsive navigation bar that extends when clicked, and this was the insipration.
Displays much better on desktop than on mobile, I still need to do some adjustments to make it perfect!

It is hosted on netlify.
